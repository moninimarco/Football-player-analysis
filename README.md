Soulé Radar chart: when analysing football stats, sometimes, we keep the focus on a certain player for a better understanding of the related performance over a league season

The code compares the stats of **Matias Soulé** (Frosinone right wing, on loan from Juventus) against the Serie A average.

Under this view, a **radar chart** has been developed by considering only Serie A's footballers with more than 450 minutes played. A normalization per 90 mins has been applied across the stats.

# Data

The dataset has been provided by the advanced platform of [Soccerment] (https://xvalue.ai/?_gl=1*x7nmmk*_ga*Nzk0MDgyMDMwLjE3MDY4MDAyNDE.*_ga_B21ZJ6LXBP*MTcwNjgwMDI0Mi4xLjAuMTcwNjgwMDI0Mi42MC4wLjA.) and it considers the first 10 games of SerieA league - season 2023/2024.

The radar chart is made through [mpl] (https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) "a Python library for plotting soccer/football charts in Matplotlib and loading StatsBomb open-data".
